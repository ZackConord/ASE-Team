# ASE-Team
This is a repo for ASE teams to track issues and plan in a repo that is not massive and extremely busy with POC issues, etc. The current set up in the Advanced Security Repo is to restrictive for quick collobartion where we can track initial ideas, etc. From there we can always transport things into the Advanced Security Repo to be formally tracked by PM.
